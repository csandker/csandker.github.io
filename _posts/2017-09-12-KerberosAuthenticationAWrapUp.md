This post is intended as a wrap-up to refresh/update your understanding of how Kerberos works in a Windows domain network.

If you want the full picture right from the source check out this post from the Microsoft docs:

> [Kerberos Explained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb742516(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN)

## Basics

Kerberos is - since Windows 2000 - the preferred authentication scheme in Windows domain networks (chosen over NTLM).<br>
Kerberos is based on tickets, which are transmitted over the wire and which need to be presented in order to get access to a certain service.
There are only two types of tickets:

* Ticket Granting Tickets (TGT)
* Ticket Granting Service (TGS)

Prior to getting access to a certain service, a user has to authenticate against the Kerberos Distribution Center (KDC). After successful authentication a TGT for that user is generated by the KDC and returned back to the user. This TGT ticket is stored on the user's client machine and is used from there on to request tickets for individual services (TGS), which have to be provided to each service in order to get access.

## Workflow
An abstraction of the Kerberos authentication scheme workflow is shown on the right.

As it can be seen here, Kerberos is solely based on tickets as a basis to grant or deny access.
Additionally to get some more insights about the contents of the individual tickets the following scheme is provided (Note that all encrypted data is enclosed in pipes):

## Attack Surface

*Disclaimer:* In the following i will only cover Kerberoasting and AS-REP Roasting as these are the most relevant attacks (from a RedTeamers perspective). Other attack may be added later on... 

### Kerberoasting
> Kerberoasting is a technique that targets service accounts with the goal of obtaining and cracking an account's password.

So what is a service account?<br>
A service account is a normal user account (having a username, a password, etc.) for which a **Service Principal Name (SPN)** has been created. An SPN is nothing more that a unique identifier for a given service. One property of an SPN is that it always includes the name of the host that the service is running on, you can understand an SPN of being the IP & PORT description of a service.<br>
For some more details right from the source have a read through this Microsoft Docs article: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/service-principal-names)

The missing bits of *what* Kerberoasting technically is and *how* it works are best understood by answering the *why*. So *why* does Kerberoasting work? *Why* can you get a service account's password in the Kerberos protocol?<br>
The answer to that is simple: Because the Kerberos protocol defines that a service account's password is contained in the TGS ticket that a user gets from the KDC in order to connect to that service. 

Looking at the the Workflow above, we can find the service account's password right in the TGS-REP:

![ServicePasswordInTGSREP](/public/img/2017-09-12-KerberosAuthenticationAWrapUp/ServicePasswordInTGS-REP.png)

In other words that means: Every time a user requests a TGS from the KDC in order to connect to that service in the next step, the account password of the user running that service we're trying to connect to is returned to us, wrapped in a TGS ticket.<br>
Obviously that password is not contained in there as plaintext password, that's why we need to crack that password in the last step.

To recap Kerberoasting is basically a three step attack chain:
- Find a suitable service account.<br>
*That is: A user account that has got an SPN*
- Request a TGS for that service
- Use an offline cracking tool, like [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or [John](https://www.openwall.com/john/) to brute force password attempts until the password is found that can decrypt the TGS  

What makes Kerberoasting especially valuable for all attacker is that no special administrative privileges are required to conduct Kerberoasting. **Any Active Directory user is allowed to query for accounts that have an SPN set, and any Active Directory user is allowed to request a TGS for any service.**

To run a Kerberoasting attack i recommend to use the amazing [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) project, e.g. with:
```
Rubeus.exe kerberoast /outfile:hashes.txt
```

The obtained service account password hash can then be cracked, e.g. using [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/):
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 13100 hashes.txt MostCommonPasswords.list -o cracked_hashes.txt
``` 

**Important note**: The returned password hashes can come in different flavors. Rubeus will tell you which algorithm was used for encrypting the password (one reason why Rubeus is great). Make a note of this so called **EType** and ensure you use your password cracker tool with the correct EType.<br>
For hashcat hash mode <u>13100</u> refers to EType 23 (which is the most common one).<br>
Other ETypes are EType 17 (hashcat mode *19600*) and EType 18 (hashcat mode *19700*).<br>
For example hashes and differences in the ETypes have a look at [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)  

**Bonus**<br>
If you read all of the above carefully you will notice that all you need to Kerberoast a user is a valid Active Directory (AD) account and a target account that has an SPN set (and thereby becomes a service user).

So hat if you create a new SPN and assign it to an arbitrary user?<br>
The answer is: You will be able to Kerberoast that user now.

If you hold write access to a user's properties (*GenericAll* or *GenericWrite* Access) you can set an SPN for that user and make it Kerberoastable.

### AS-REP Roasting

AS-REP Roasting is a little less known, but follows the same idea Kerberoasting is based on, which is: Crack a user's password contained in a ticket.

In contrast to Kerberoasting in AS-REP Roasting not service account is targeted, but a "normal" user account aka. a user account without an SPN.<br>
The mechanics of AS-REP Roasting are completely the same as with Kerberoasting and i will describe the *what* and the *how* just as i did above, by explaining the *why*.<br>
Long story short: You can crack a user's password because it's given to you in the AS-REP response:

![UserPasswordInASREP](/public/img/2017-09-12-KerberosAuthenticationAWrapUp/UserPasswordInAS-REP.png)

**The catch**: You can't just request an AS-REP for any user in the domain, because you need to authenticate first. In the image above you will see that the AS-REQ also contains the user's password hash, meaning you need to know the user's password before you can get an AS-REP for that user. This is often referred to as **preauthentication**.

Obviously if i need to know a user's password in the first place this attack is pretty useless.<br>
The reason this attack exist is that although preauthentication is enabled by default for all user accounts, it can be disabled, allowing every domain user to obtain a hash of the user's password.

![UserWithoutKerberosPreAuthentication](/public/img/2017-09-12-KerberosAuthenticationAWrapUp/UserWithoutPreAuth.png)

So in essence AS-REP Roasting is an attack consisting of these three steps:
- Find a suitable user account.<br>
*That is: A user account that does not require preauthentication*
- Get a AS-REP packet for that user
- Use an offline cracking tool, like [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or [John](https://www.openwall.com/john/) to brute force password attempts until the user password is found.

Just like with Kerberos this attack can be run with [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus)...
```
Rubeus.exe asreproast /outfile:hashes.txt /format:hashcat
```

... and [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/)
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 hashes.txt MostCommonPasswords.list -o cracked_hashes.txt
```

**Important note**: Just as with Kerberoasting the hashcat's hash mode <u>18200</u> refers to **EType 23**, see: [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)
